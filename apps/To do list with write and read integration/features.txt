1. Save and read lines from page and txt
2. txt will be loaded as a full array of text that has no seperation
how do i seperate it?

I need something to signify the beggining and ending of a line.
ex. 

(<-- This begins the line,,  and this ends it -->)
what ever is in between these lines is one line of text that will corespond to one LI element


So when we read the li from the page and prepare for saving, we need to go trough each LI element
and add to it the ( and ) signs.

we then save each of those to a txt file.

Then when we load. we save the txt info in an array
we then run the array trough a loop where if char === ( you will take every char and save it, until you come to a ) in which case
 that is the end of one array
