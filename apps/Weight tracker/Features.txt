We need to store data by weeks when getting the weekly status change..
So we need to check each entry date and store it by weeks..
so week 1, week 2, week 3 etc..

then we can pull out the numbers from week 1 and 2, and get the average change.. etc.

what happens when we need to compare week 1 with the previous week (week 5 or 4 of previous month)
Well we will have the data from the prevous month still in week 4 or 5 since we didn't overwrite it..


We also need to save these averages for a yearly tracking cycle..
so when we check for monthly changes we will store the average for each month inside a yearly storage.
then at the end of year, we average these numbers and get the 


I could also store the week number in the entry itself..
When i create it, i run the get week function and store that number as well..

Might be better than to check each one at once..
not only that.. i will have to check each one every time i add another entry..

So instead of that..I will add the date upon entry creation..
and then when i need to update it, i just collect all weeks that i need and combine..


So i need to store what..
In the storage object of each element, next to id i need to also have week number and month number..

so.. "weekNum": ex. 2 , "monthNum" : ex. 5 , "yearNum"

Also, new storage place will hold all the averages..
as well as each month
ex. newItem("Averages")


	"monthlyAverage": ex. +23 or -42
	"yearlyAverage" : ex. +32 or -34
Then we compare the old yearlyAverage with the new one..
as well as the monthly average

Creation of new element and deletion of element will cause the update of monthly and yearly 
average both in storage and the STATUS showcase
