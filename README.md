## About my projects
-----
Level 1-3.. That was my way of spliting a big problem, into smaller pieces..
A way of dividing full-stack web development, into multiple pieces and handling 
them one at a time..

Level 1 was introduction to javascript, the basics, learning the syntax
Level 2 was about diving deeper into javascript and the logic..

Level 3 is the final level..
First project was my test of javascript understanding.. The web scrapper..
The second project will include react, mongoDB etc.
(if after the second one, i think i lack some knowledge somewhere, i will add one more project..)
